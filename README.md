The game is developed using the Pygame library, with Tiled Map Editor used for designing and managing in-game maps. Players can explore the world, cultivate crops, interact with NPCs, and engage in various activities that blend adventure and farming mechanics. The game aims to deliver a relaxing yet engaging experience, allowing players to build their own virtual farm while uncovering the secrets of the land.
